### OpenBullet2 
<no shade> 
<br> 
<tt>OB2 is a popular tool used by threat actors and ethical testers/researchers alike. Initially I struggled in working with the necessary Dotnet configuration, got confused easily and gave up on the tool rather quickly because I did'nt have an immediate need for it. After reading an article recently that had to do with some recent attacks and how the tool was used for credential stuffing I decided to give it a try and see for myself what made this particular tool such a valuable weapon for cyber criminals.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>After a little bit of troubleshooting and reading some of the official documentation found in the projects repository, I was up and running. And so the testing begins. Today was primarily focused towards making sure that I had a solid grasp on how the tool uses proxies, which proxies are most sucessful and how to use them within the tool.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I noticed that there were'nt many clear cut tutorials on youtube. Most were vague or misleading and had no audio. Once I feel adept, I plan to create a user guide and video series thats more of a "OB2 for dummies" style instructional with clear and concise breakdowns of the tool</tt><br>
