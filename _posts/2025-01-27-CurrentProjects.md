### OpenBullet2 
<no shade> 
<br> 
<tt>OB2 is a popular tool used by threat actors and ethical testers/researchers alike. Initially I was unable to install the package, got confused easily and gave up on the tool rather quickly. After reading an article over the weekend that had to do with how the tool was being used for credential stuffing I decided to give it a try.</tt>
