### Analysts Comments;
<tt>The Majority of my training has been fueled by a genuine love for systems and analytics. Up until the the last year or so (as of 2025) I have been primarily 
self taught. I eventually was accepted into a local program that serves underpriviledged communities in the Wilmington, Delaware area. The program is called 
"Code Differently" and is partnered with Tech-Impact. Initially I was skeptical and thought that they were more than likely just another 'bootcamp' that enticed
folks with the idea of completing a 90 day course that would lead to career placement with a respectable organization. There are so many of those style programs
out there in which most graduates report having no success in finding steady gainful employment. Code Difeerently was however just that... Different. Their staff,
instructors, course material and teaching methods far exceeded my expectations and sent me in a direction that I will forever be grateful for. I think the most
important thing about navigating a career in tech is a general passion and curiosity for the systems that now make up the world around us. I intend to continue to
pursue my passions and ultimately hope to utilize my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on my community at large. In my mind, there is no better way
to pay it forward.</tt>
